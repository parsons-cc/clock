# Timepiece

## Assignment

Create a time-based composition for the browser. It should _respond_ to time, but doesn't need to be a _clock_.

 * [Download this project here](https://github.com/parsons-cc/timepiece/archive/gh-pages.zip) to get started.
 * [View the sample project in your browser](http://cc.andydayton.com/timepiece/).

### Resources

You can use the date/time functions provided by p5.js:

 * [`day()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/day)
 * [`hour()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/hour)
 * [`minute()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/minute)
 * [`millis()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/millis)
 * [`month()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/month)
 * [`second()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/second)
 * [`year()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/year)

### Grading

Your finished project must satisfy the following criteria:

 1. It should load in the browser (it should work)
 2. It should change over time
 3. It should be uploaded to a publicly available server (your class site via GitHub)

You will also be graded on overall execution.

## Project Setup

For basic functionality you can just double-click on `index.html` and open in your browser (Chrome is preferred). If you want to do things like load images, video, or sound or other advanced p5 features then you might want to use the local server instructions below.

### Local server

If you want to use more of p5js's functionality, you may need to run a local server for development. [You can find instructions here.](https://gist.github.com/daytona1/3a687b46a43236055819)
